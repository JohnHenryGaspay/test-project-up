		<h3 class="subh3">Hey, what's up? I'm Chad Harris </h3>
		<section class="blackbg">
		<p>– and I’d like to extend you a warm welcome to my site. In the early 2000s, I started as a fitness instructor in my hometown. I eventually got into writing and began a career as a writer and contributor for several fitness magazine publications. Back then, I focused on weight management and bodybuilding, eventually tackling nutrition and supplements. Now, I run my own fitness network, bridging personal fitness trainers to their prospective clientele. </p>
		<p>Fitness and nutrition have been the focal points of my career. For years, I’ve dealt with men who frequently struggled from bad lifestyle choices to poor nutrition that led them to an overall breakdown of their quality of life. I sympathize with every single client who wished they can turn back time and make better choices, but with an aging body, the options left to correct the choices you’ve made are extremely limited. </p>
		<p>It’s no secret that men feel hopeless when their ability to perform sexually weakens. Some see it as a sign of the end of being a man, which leads some to feel depressed and desperate for a solution. I created this website to help men choose the right solution to combat aging through the right male enhancement solutions.  </p>
		<p>While lacking a degree in Nutrition, I made up for it with real research and real-life interactions with people whose lives we’ve changed over the years. Now in my 40s, I’m faced with the same problem my clients have, which is aging. I had to put my supplement theory and experience into practice, and this website chronicles my own experience on how I conquered aging by eliminating my physical weaknesses and confidence that eroded over the years. </p>
		<p>AGING doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a slow buildup of small issues that eventually lead to even bigger problems as you get older. Through science, we’ll discuss the ins and outs of male enhancement supplements to help address the signs of aging, and avoid the pitfalls of using the wrong male enhancement solution. </p>

			<section>
			<p>What does it take to conquer aging? Chad Harris gives the answer to the most significant question that most men are afraid to ask. Aging is often looked at as an unavoidable circumstance that men would eventually have to learn to accept. As a fitness instructor and fitness expert, Chad Harris helps men navigate through the complex world of supplements, nutrition, and the science of aging to determine how you can effectively overcome aging and discover life like you never thought possible.</p> 
			<p>Throughout his career in Fitness and Nutrition, Chad Harris has worked with hundreds of clients and other experts in the same field, developing his own brand of health and wellness that focuses on nutrition and the right supplementation. </p>
			<p>On this website, you can expect to discover popular misconceptions about aging and supplements, and how you can better inform yourself to identify the right solutions for your situation. </p>
			<p>Male enhancement is a key topic that will be discussed on this website. While there are plenty of wellness supplements to choose from, Chad Harris has identified male-specific supplements to be the most effective in promoting better function, performance, and overall satisfaction.</p>
			<img class="imgbanner" src="images/chads-special-announcement.jpg" alt="image of special announcement" title="special announcement">
			 
            <p>As simple as it may seem, not all supplements are designed to produce the best results in men. Other supplements in the same segment may not yield ideal results, and could easily lead to disappointment, despair, and loss of confidence. </p>
			<p>Chad Harris, through his extensive experience in fitness and nutrition, firmly believes that the key to overcoming aging is through proper nutrition, male enhancement supplementation, and physical activity. The secret to success is identifying which supplements you should take to maintain your youthful energy and vigor. </p>
			<p>Sorting out the endless selection of supplements could be time-consuming and confusing. Without the right guidance, choosing the right supplement could be an endless and expensive chase to find the right product for your needs. </p>
			<p>It shouldn’t be this way, but that’s just the way things are.</p>
			<p>Well, I’ve got good news for you: I’m here to make it easier for you.</p>
			<p>With my background in fitness and nutrition and my own personal experience as a man who has recently faced the same problems, I can help you pick the right supplement solution that caters to your own needs, to get you the results you want and more. </p>
			<p>This is why I, along with my team of intrepid researchers, have compiled 5 of the best male enhancement products currently out in the market today: each of them with its own unique benefits and effects, for you to be able to discern which product is perfect for you.</p>
			<p>On this project, I worked with a team of various health and nutrition experts to bring you the best supplement recommendations that will help you conquer aging once and for all. </p>
			<p>Aging is a deeply personal matter to me, which is why I made it my personal goal to disseminate the information we have, the best way possible. To make our evaluations strictly objective, we follow an 8-step rule when reviewing male enhancement supplements: 
			 <ul class="list-unstyled">
			  <li>Scientific references</li>
			  <li>Quality of ingredients </li>
			  <li>Customer reviews </li>
			  <li>Product testing </li>
			  <li>Brand reputation </li>
			  <li>Customer service </li>
			  <li>Money-back guarantee </li>
			  <li>Overall supplement quality </li>
			</ul>
			<p style="color:grey;">*Individual results may vary</p>
			<p> Each supplement will be graded on the aforementioned basis – which should help you make the right decision before you embark on your journey into male enhancement.</p>
			<p> Without further ado, check out the top 5 male enhancement pills, starting with #1: UltraCore Power™.</p>

			<h3>Chad Harris’s Top 5 Male Enhancement Products<h3>
			<h4 class="subh4 colorbg">#1: UltraCore Power™</h4>
            <section>
			<p>An all-around superior product with unmatched potency and technology</p>
			  <img class="imgbanner1 prod1" src="images/ultra-core-power.jpg" alt="image of ultra core power" title="ultra core power">
			<p class="floatext">UltraCore Power shouldn’t be a surprise selection at #1. After all, it’s a massive combination of three top-of-the-line supplements that make up the best test-boosting experience ever. The rationale behind having three supplements as the core formulation is simple. Everything you need to boost test wouldn’t fit in a single-product formulation. That’s why UltraCore Power is made up of three of the best supplements available – Male UltraCore, Ultra Prime, and Ultra Edge. This unbeatable combination sparks the best-ever results that no other product on the market can match.</p>
			       <a href="#"> <img class="imgbutton" src="images/visit-official-website.jpg" alt="image of visite official site" title="visite official site link added"></a>
            <p>UltraCore Power™ is my ONLY go-to testosterone-boosting complex. Even with all my years trying to maintain a healthy physique and nutrition, I was unable to keep up with aging, until I used UltraCore Power™. </p>
			<p>This is, by all applicable definitions, the best performance supplement you can get your hands on. You don’t even have to be an expert to realize that it’s the best in the business; you only have to compare the label and see how much more UltraCore Power™ offers than any other male enhancement brand. Three supplements, one easy package. It doesn’t get any better than that. Other companies I’ve seen would try to convince you that one product is enough to give you the results you want, but you’ll soon realize that it never really will. UltraCore Power gives you everything you could ever wish for in your male performance supplement, and that’s why it’s ranked #1 – not just by me, but plenty of other critics online too. </p>
			<p>Calling UltraCore Power™ “superior” to other male enhancement brands is grossly undervaluing this amazing product; it’s on a class of its own. We’ve reviewed hundreds of products, and came to the conclusion that UltraCore Power™ offers the most complete, most impactful, and most effective formula that will definitely bring results you never thought possible. </p>
			<p>UltraCore Power™ is a completely different experience that you simply can’t afford to miss out on. From raising t-levels to enhancing your performance and vigor, UltraCore Power™ doesn’t hold anything back. With the cutting-edge technology and formulation of UltraCore Power™, you can expect your performance, satisfaction, and confidence to reach new heights.</p>
