		<h3 class="subh3">Hey, what's up? I'm Chad Harris </h3>
		<section class="blackbg">
		<p>– and I’d like to extend you a warm welcome to my site. In the early 2000s, I started as a fitness instructor in my hometown. I eventually got into writing and began a career as a writer and contributor for several fitness magazine publications. Back then, I focused on weight management and bodybuilding, eventually tackling nutrition and supplements. Now, I run my own fitness network, bridging personal fitness trainers to their prospective clientele. </p>
		<p>Fitness and nutrition have been the focal points of my career. For years, I’ve dealt with men who frequently struggled from bad lifestyle choices to poor nutrition that led them to an overall breakdown of their quality of life. I sympathize with every single client who wished they can turn back time and make better choices, but with an aging body, the options left to correct the choices you’ve made are extremely limited. </p>
		<p>It’s no secret that men feel hopeless when their ability to perform sexually weakens. Some see it as a sign of the end of being a man, which leads some to feel depressed and desperate for a solution. I created this website to help men choose the right solution to combat aging through the right male enhancement solutions.  </p>
		<p>While lacking a degree in Nutrition, I made up for it with real research and real-life interactions with people whose lives we’ve changed over the years. Now in my 40s, I’m faced with the same problem my clients have, which is aging. I had to put my supplement theory and experience into practice, and this website chronicles my own experience on how I conquered aging by eliminating my physical weaknesses and confidence that eroded over the years. </p>
		<p>AGING doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a slow buildup of small issues that eventually lead to even bigger problems as you get older. Through science, we’ll discuss the ins and outs of male enhancement supplements to help address the signs of aging, and avoid the pitfalls of using the wrong male enhancement solution. </p>

			<section>
			<p>What does it take to conquer aging? Chad Harris gives the answer to the most significant question that most men are afraid to ask. Aging is often looked at as an unavoidable circumstance that men would eventually have to learn to accept. As a fitness instructor and fitness expert, Chad Harris helps men navigate through the complex world of supplements, nutrition, and the science of aging to determine how you can effectively overcome aging and discover life like you never thought possible.</p> 
			<p>Throughout his career in Fitness and Nutrition, Chad Harris has worked with hundreds of clients and other experts in the same field, developing his own brand of health and wellness that focuses on nutrition and the right supplementation. </p>
			<p>On this website, you can expect to discover popular misconceptions about aging and supplements, and how you can better inform yourself to identify the right solutions for your situation. </p>
			<p>Male enhancement is a key topic that will be discussed on this website. While there are plenty of wellness supplements to choose from, Chad Harris has identified male-specific supplements to be the most effective in promoting better function, performance, and overall satisfaction.</p>
			<img class="imgbanner" src="images/chads-special-announcement.jpg" alt="image of special announcement" title="special announcement">
			 
            <p>As simple as it may seem, not all supplements are designed to produce the best results in men. Other supplements in the same segment may not yield ideal results, and could easily lead to disappointment, despair, and loss of confidence. </p>
			<p>Chad Harris, through his extensive experience in fitness and nutrition, firmly believes that the key to overcoming aging is through proper nutrition, male enhancement supplementation, and physical activity. The secret to success is identifying which supplements you should take to maintain your youthful energy and vigor. </p>
			<p>Sorting out the endless selection of supplements could be time-consuming and confusing. Without the right guidance, choosing the right supplement could be an endless and expensive chase to find the right product for your needs. </p>
			<p>It shouldn’t be this way, but that’s just the way things are.</p>
			<p>Well, I’ve got good news for you: I’m here to make it easier for you.</p>
			<p>With my background in fitness and nutrition and my own personal experience as a man who has recently faced the same problems, I can help you pick the right supplement solution that caters to your own needs, to get you the results you want and more. </p>
			<p>This is why I, along with my team of intrepid researchers, have compiled 5 of the best male enhancement products currently out in the market today: each of them with its own unique benefits and effects, for you to be able to discern which product is perfect for you.</p>
			<p>On this project, I worked with a team of various health and nutrition experts to bring you the best supplement recommendations that will help you conquer aging once and for all. </p>
			<p>Aging is a deeply personal matter to me, which is why I made it my personal goal to disseminate the information we have, the best way possible. To make our evaluations strictly objective, we follow an 8-step rule when reviewing male enhancement supplements: 
			 <ul class="list-unstyled">
			  <li>Scientific references</li>
			  <li>Quality of ingredients </li>
			  <li>Customer reviews </li>
			  <li>Product testing </li>
			  <li>Brand reputation </li>
			  <li>Customer service </li>
			  <li>Money-back guarantee </li>
			  <li>Overall supplement quality </li>
			</ul>
			<p style="color:grey;">*Individual results may vary</p>
			<p> Each supplement will be graded on the aforementioned basis – which should help you make the right decision before you embark on your journey into male enhancement.</p>
			<p> Without further ado, check out the top 5 male enhancement pills, starting with #1: UltraCore Power™.</p>

			  <h4 class="subh4 colorbg">#1: UltraCore Power™</h4>
            <section>
				<p class="p1">An all-around superior product with unmatched potency and technology</p>
				  <img class="imgbanner1 prod1" src="images/ultra-core-power.jpg" alt="image of ultra core power" title="ultra core power">
				<p class="floatext">UltraCore Power shouldn’t be a surprise selection at #1. After all, it’s a massive combination of three top-of-the-line supplements that make up the best test-boosting experience ever. The rationale behind having three supplements as the core formulation is simple. Everything you need to boost test wouldn’t fit in a single-product formulation. That’s why UltraCore Power is made up of three of the best supplements available – Male UltraCore, Ultra Prime, and Ultra Edge. This unbeatable combination sparks the best-ever results that no other product on the market can match.</p>
					   <a href="#"> <img class="imgbutton" src="images/visit-official-website.jpg" alt="image of visite official site" title="visite official site link added"></a>
				<p>UltraCore Power™ is my ONLY go-to testosterone-boosting complex. Even with all my years trying to maintain a healthy physique and nutrition, I was unable to keep up with aging, until I used UltraCore Power™. </p>
				<p>This is, by all applicable definitions, the best performance supplement you can get your hands on. You don’t even have to be an expert to realize that it’s the best in the business; you only have to compare the label and see how much more UltraCore Power™ offers than any other male enhancement brand. Three supplements, one easy package. It doesn’t get any better than that. Other companies I’ve seen would try to convince you that one product is enough to give you the results you want, but you’ll soon realize that it never really will. UltraCore Power gives you everything you could ever wish for in your male performance supplement, and that’s why it’s ranked #1 – not just by me, but plenty of other critics online too. </p>
				<p>Calling UltraCore Power™ “superior” to other male enhancement brands is grossly undervaluing this amazing product; it’s on a class of its own. We’ve reviewed hundreds of products, and came to the conclusion that UltraCore Power™ offers the most complete, most impactful, and most effective formula that will definitely bring results you never thought possible. </p>
				<p>UltraCore Power™ is a completely different experience that you simply can’t afford to miss out on. From raising t-levels to enhancing your performance and vigor, UltraCore Power™ doesn’t hold anything back. With the cutting-edge technology and formulation of UltraCore Power™, you can expect your performance, satisfaction, and confidence to reach new heights.</p>
				 <br>
				 <h5 class="subh5"> More than just a male enhancement supplement </h5>
				 <p>UltraCore Power™ clearly shows its superiority to other male performance products with the qualities that matter the most – the supplement’s technology and ingredients. While other brands are recognizable through their ads and hype, UltraCore Power™ is better known for its actual results, which are bar none the best in the business. </p>
				   <img class="imgbanner2" src="images/gray-color-male-enhancement.jpg" alt="image color male enhancement" title="color male enhancement">
				 
				 <p>I’ve always thought about male enhancement supplements to be completely focused on sexual performance - UltraCore Power™ is a completely different breed that focuses on the CORE of being a man – Androgens. These are the compounds that are responsible for all your masculine traits, including libido, lean muscle growth, and physical performance. </p>
				 <p>By enhancing the male core, UltraCore Power™ effectively allows your body to reach the peak of male performance. That’s why UltraCore Power™ is MORE than just a male enhancement supplement - it’s the complete male enhancement solution you need to conquer aging, performance issues, libido, and much more. </p>
				 <p>The results aren’t just promising; it’s proven by thousands of men who take UltraCore Power™ daily. Getting the right supplement to boost your core androgens could make such a huge impact on your outlook in life, especially when it comes to your performance and confidence. </p>
				 <h5 class="subh5"> Premium technology, world-class quality </h5>    
				<p>No objective review would be complete without discussing the science, technology, and formulation that makes each product unique and effective – and it’s in this aspect where UltraCore Power™ truly shines the brightest. </p>
				<p>UltraCore Power™ is the first-ever supplement powered by two supplement technologies, namely VI-PEX and STEM. These two technologies were developed from the ground up by UltraCore Power™ to produce the results needed to achieve better performance and function. Not only that, but UltraCore Power also features InstaTest Complex and SynerTech formula to further boost your results. These added technologies are made for one purpose only – to exponentially increase the results you get when you use UltraCore Power. </p>
				<p>Keeping things simple, I’ll explain the principles that led UltraCore Power™ to develop these two breakthrough technologies. </p>
				<p>When men get older, the two main factors that contribute the most to performance decline are blood flow problems and reduced t-levels. As men get older, it’s normal to experience a declining blood supply to your extremities, including the male organ. This leads to weaker erections and poor stamina. It’s also expected to have declining androgens as you get older, which affects your libido, lean muscle development, and energy. </p>
				<p>To address these two factors, UltraCore Power™ developed VI-PEX and STEM, both with completely reimagined processes to fix the weaknesses that contribute to your decline as you get older. </p>
				<p>VI-PEX mainly tackles blood supply problems through the use of effective vasodilation, while STEM enhances and sustains t-levels through the right combination of ingredients. These two technologies power UltraCore Power™, and it’s the main reason why UltraCore Power™ is ahead of its time. </p>
                 
				 <h5 class="subh5"> VI-PEX Technology </h5>  
				<p>VI-PEX combines ingredients that may help improve your declining blood flow through a delayed-release method that makes it both safe and effective. Through an optimized blood flow, you may be able to attain your desired performance. VI-PEX is further enhanced by STEM technology, which greatly enhances your t-levels.</p>
				<h5 class="subh5">STEM Technology </h5>
				<p>STEM Technology is one of the factors that make UltraCore Power™ a genuinely unique male enhancement supplement. The ability of STEM technology to enhance t-levels by boosting and suppressing the right androgens is second to none. </p>
				<p>Low T-levels is one of the reasons why men feel weaker and less confident as they get older. Naturally, t-levels start to decline after puberty, as the body no longer needs high t-levels to develop male characteristics. The problem with T-levels is, it may appear as “normal” which is the minimum threshold for a healthy body, but it’s not as high as you want it to be if you want to enhance your libido and performance. </p>
				<p>STEM Technology’s ability to boost and sustain T-levels make UltraCore Power™ the most advanced t-level-boosting supplement ever developed on the market today. This results in an impactful change in energy, libido, and performance. </p>
				<h5 class="subh5">InstaTest Complex</h5>
				<p>UltraCore Power takes it a step further by creating another homegrown technology used exclusively in Ultra Prime. InstaTest Complex focuses on enhancing the bioavailability and absorption of the nutrients introduced by UltraCore Power. This means that you get more ingredients absorbed, leading to better overall results. </p>
				<h5 class="subh5">SynerTech Formula</h5>
				<p>SynerTech is the final boosting stage of UltraCore Power as it brings all of the components together and creates a seamless follow-through of the components, allowing it to further maximize your results. SynerTech is used exclusively on Ultra Edge, and it primarily focuses on synergizing the ingredients, delivering a more focused, more impactful outcome. </p>
				<h5 class="subh5">Top-of-the-line ingredients.</h5>
				<p>You may be asking – What’s in UltraCore Power™ that makes it so effective? </p>
				<p>It’s all in the ingredients. Not only does UltraCore Power™ heavily invest in research and development, but they also put a lot in on the ingredients used in the formula. I’ve gone through hundreds of male enhancement supplements, and only a small fraction of brands use standardized extracts for their formulas. Even so, not many brands use extracts with high enough concentrations. </p>
				<p>Standardized extracts are basically isolated compounds from the organic ingredient, and the percentage represents how much of the compound is present relative to the ingredient content. If a supplement has 500mg of an ingredient and is standardized to 50%, then you can expect at least 250mg of the active component present in the formula. The result? The ingredient has a bigger impact on the overall formula compared to other powder-based ingredients. </p>
				<p>The reason? Standardized extracts are incredibly expensive. Isolating, purifying and extracting the active components require several processing levels, which contribute to the expensive cost to manufacture these ingredients. Even so, UltraCore Power™ uses such high-quality ingredients to produce results like no other supplement in the market, and it manages to keep the cost affordable to consumers even with such a high processing cost. </p>
				<h5 class="subh5">The last performance supplement you’ll ever need</h5>
				<p>Think about this – when you’re in the market for a male enhancement supplement, would you rather settle for a cheap product that has questionable results? </p>
				<p>If you’re like me who prioritizes results, then UltraCore Power™ is by far the most cost-effective choice. Through comparing supplements and their price points, UltraCore Power™ offers more, delivers more, and makes the biggest impact on your sexual performance and overall satisfaction. </p>
				<p>Truth be told, there are many other supplements on the market that could produce decent results, but when it comes to something as intimate as sexual performance, you simply couldn’t afford to roll the dice. You need a sure thing, and that’s what UltraCore Power™ offers.</p>
				<p>The real question is – how much do you value your sexual performance and overall well-being? As a guy in his 40s, I could definitely say that I have no time to test every single product that claims to be the best. That’s why I rely on good ‘ol science and common sense to choose products to try. UltraCore Power™ is not my first male enhancement supplement, and through my own experience, I determined that UltraCore Power™ doesn’t just look good on paper; its real value is in the results you get after taking the product daily. </p>
				<h5 class="subh5">How UltraCore Power dominates the competition</h5>
				<p>Let’s be crystal clear on one point – many other male enhancement supplements that claim to be able to increase your test levels and can actually pull it off. The real question is – by how much? </p>
				<p>Some supplements exaggerate the results you get since the ingredients they used references some distant study that claims to be effective in increasing such traits. What really makes UltraCore Power™ different is the formulation that aims to deliver results that you can be satisfied with. There’s no exaggeration, overselling, or overestimating the results you get with the product. If your expectations have been dampened by years of taking supplements that do not work as advertised, then UltraCore Power™ would definitely change your mind. </p>
				<p>UltraCore Power is a supplement and not a drug. You’re not curing a disease or symptom; you’re adding to your nutrition to bring about changes you want for your body. A lot of times, tests would show up normal, but you want something better, something more than what can only be classified as normal. UltraCore Power™ is the supplement that takes you to the next level. </p>
				<p>UltraCore Power™ isn’t hesitant in saying that the product takes time to work because that’s what the science says. I’ve never seen a supplement product work overnight, and all the supplement studies suggest that it takes at least 3-6 months for a supplement to work.</p>
				<p>Here’s the big caveat in taking UltraCore Power™ - the best results occur after taking UltraCore Power™ daily for 8-12 weeks. If you’re not prepared to commit to taking UltraCore Power™ for three months, then I’d suggest you re-evaluate your decision to buy male enhancement pills. You’d just be wasting money if you only take a supplement for one month, and I mean it with all sincerity. You can’t expect a fat burner to make you slim after taking it for 30 days, so why expect UltraCore Power™, which changes a lot more in your body, to work in just a month?</p>
				<p>If you’re firm in your decision to overcome aging, regain your sexual performance, and change your life, then there’s no better male enhancement supplement than UltraCore Power™.</p>
                
				<h5 class="subh5">Is the Premier Loyalty Pricing worth it?</h5>
				<img class="imgbanner3" src="images/ultracore-power.jpg" alt="image of ultra power" title="ultra power">
				<p>UltraCore Power offers a whopping 50% off your monthly payment if you complete three consecutive months of taking UltraCore Power. Surely, you’d think – three months just to get the savings? Will that be worth it by then?</p>
				<p>My take on this is – YES. Let’s put things in perspective. Many of you believe that you’re saving money when you buy by the dozen – which is true. You’re paying less per unit of the product, and the rest would just have to sit in your storage until you use them. The same goes for supplements. Some supplement brands offer good discounts when you buy in bulk, but unfortunately, the other supplements would have to sit in your storage for the next few months, which may affect the “freshness” of the product. Surely, you wouldn’t want to take old or expired supplements, so it wouldn’t be applicable in this situation.</p>
				<p>UltraCore Power’s Premier Loyalty Pricing gives you the option to get your supply of fresh UltraCore Power bottles sent to your address every month. </p>
				<p>By simply following through on your UltraCore Power order, you’d get a big 33% discount starting on your 2nd month! If you register for free on ClubUltraCore.com, you also get a free UltraCore essentials supplement of your choice every month PLUS a discount of 60% on your 4th month onwards! If you do the math, for a 6-month period, you’d already save around $150 off the regular price. I doubt if any bulk discount offers can match the same amount. The best part is, you get a new bottle every month, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the supplement.</p>
				<p>By the third month, you may already experience the results promised by UltraCore Power, and it just makes more sense to continue taking UltraCore Power for as long as you need its benefits. Having a discount in place after the third month makes it easier on the budget to continue enjoying the life-changing benefits of UltraCore Power.</p>
				<p>Lastly, one thing you need to make sure of prior to taking UltraCore Power™ is to buy the product on the official website. There have been reports of fake UltraCore Power™ pills being sold over the open market, and many men interested in the product are being duped into buying counterfeit pills. Apart from ensuring the safety and the quality of UltraCore Power™, you are covered by a money-back guarantee by buying directly from the website.</p>

				  <img class="imgbanner1 prod1" src="images/alpha-xxl.jpg" alt="image of alpha xxl product" title="alpha xxl product">
				<p class="floatext">You may not have heard of Alpha XXL as it doesn’t have a big marketing machine to promote its brand, but next to UltraCore Power, Alpha XXL is probably the next best thing, but the difference between the two is so massive that it’s actually unfair to UltraCore Power to call Alpha XXL the next best thing. UltraCore Power is on a league of its own. There’s just no way that you’d compare a powerhouse 3-supplement product to a single product brand. That being said, Alpha XXL still has positive points that make it the top supplement next to UltraCore Power. </p>
					   <a href="#"> <img class="imgbutton" src="images/visit-official-website.jpg" alt="image of visite official site" title="visite official site link added"></a>
				<p>Alpha XXL may not be enough to compete directly with UltraCore Power, but the formulation of this product, compared with other test boosters on the market makes it a reasonable option for those who aren’t prepared to take on a product as potent as UltraCore Power. Alpha XXL has great ingredients such as Tongkat Ali, Muira Puama, and Tribulus Terrestris, which could deliver amazing test-boosting results in the long run. If you’re patient with your results, you may consider Alpha XXL as your next supplement. </p>
				<p>Alpha XXL deserves the #2 spot on this list simply because it delivers better test-boosting results than most of the supplements on the market today. Although pricey to some degree, some customers might consider taking Alpha XXL because of its ingredient selection and the promise of a much better test-boosting performance. If you’re looking for a supplement that will considerably boost test without </p>

				<p class="p1">Boost your test and libido levels to peak levels</p>
				  <img class="imgbanner1 prod1" src="images/testo-grade.jpg" alt="image of testo grade" title="testo grade">
				<p class="floatext">You may have heard of Testograde, the test-boosting supplement that claims to enhance your core performance. It’s also said that Testograde is one of the fastest-acting test-boosting supplements on the market. It does make Testograde more appealing to its customers, but those who hastily take the product may find its claims exaggerated. Yes, the product is effective as a test-booster, but there are no supplements that can have near-instantaneous results. That alone is my sole objection to Testograde. It could have been amazing if the results match the claims.</p>
					   <a href="#"> <img class="imgbutton" src="images/visit-official-website.jpg" alt="image of visite official site" title="visite official site link added"></a>
				<p> Test, as we all know, is essential for healthy sexual performance for men – it promotes plenty of aspects of male reproductive health as well as increased muscle and bone mass, as well as for general health and well-being. TestoGrade contains what it says to be the most versatile test-boosting triple-action formula currently out in the market today, and I am inclined to believe this, thanks in no small part due to the various positive reviews it has received among those who have tried to increase their test levels.</p>
				<p> Testograde is great for those who want a steady test booster that can reliably enhance t-levels, but you’ll just have to take its claims with a grain of salt. While it’s not as impressive as the top product in my list, it does have the high points that make it deserving to be on this list. It’s a great example of what a good test product should be, formula-wise, but as with all supplements that want to remain relevant for years to come, Testograde should also consider re-evaluating its formula to keep up with the best products on the market today. </p>

				  <img class="imgbanner1 prod1" src="images/ultra-test-elite.jpg" alt="image of ultra test elite" title="ultra test elite">
				<p class="floatext">Ultra Test Elite is one of those supplements you can truly call a true test booster, with capabilities exceeding what you’d expect from your average male performance supplement. Ultra Test Booster has the perfect concept that was executed well from paper to the real thing. The formula could be considered as one of those that succeeded before products like UltraCore Power dominated the scene, but as with all supplements that were once great, Ultra Test Elite should also consider reformulating their product to match those products at the top.  </p>
					   <a href="#"> <img class="imgbutton" src="images/visit-official-website.jpg" alt="image of visite official site" title="visite official site link added"></a>
				<p>  As far as results go, Ultra-Test Elite certainly delivers its payload with its own particular formula that boasts high-potency ingredients. I am inclined to believe that this claim is true because, from my experience, I have seen the androgenic results of increased test levels shortly after going on the product after trying it for the first time. Again, in an industry as competitive as male enhancement goes, just finding a product that delivers half of what it says is a product worth its weight in gold – and Ultra-Test Elite delivers in spades.</p>
				<p>  A few years back, Ultra Test Elite customers were amazed at what the product could accomplish -  a decent improvement in test levels could be felt through their energy and performance. Although the results were significant, the development of new, more capable products made these results mediocre. Still, given that there aren’t many products that would match the capabilities of Ultra Test Elite, I thought I’d include this product in my lineup just to give you more options depending on how effective or potent you’d like your test-boosting supplement to be. </p>
				<p>  That said, Ultra-Test Elite is a great product for those of you who want to see how far you can go as far as your test levels go, and see the androgenic benefits of it. It’s worth a shot, especially if you find yourself lacking the energy and performance to perform at your highest levels. While effects vary from person to person, Ultra Test Elite is consistent enough to be considered effective, and you may find the results ample to what you’d need. Whether you are seeking the androgenic or anabolic benefits of test, Ultra-Test Elite is one to keep in your shortlist.</p>

            <section>
				<p class="p1">An adult entertainment performer favorite now available for the first time</p>
				  <img class="imgbanner1 prod1" src="images/maximum-male-pro.jpg" alt="image of maximum male pro" title="maximum male pro">
				<p class="floatext">Apart from athletes, adult entertainment performers are the kind of professionals that need test-boosters to maintain their peak performance. Maximum Male Pro is one of those products that were specifically marketed by people in the adult entertainment industry, claiming that it can increase energy and performance. Being promoted by such a sketchy industry actually affected how people perceive this product, but it doesn’t take away the fact that Maximum Male Pro is still a great test booster that can produce real-life results. 
					Since it was marketed to a specific niche, most men who take Maximum Male Pro expect sexual benefits from taking the product. </p>
					   <a href="#"> <img class="imgbutton" src="images/visit-official-website.jpg" alt="image of visite official site" title="visite official site link added"></a>
					<p> Although Maximum Male Pro is effective as a test-booster, the formula is more focused on increasing test and not sexual performance. It makes people expect something from the product that it cannot deliver. In my opinion, Maximum Male Pro would do a lot better if it was marketed as a test booster for physical performance – at least it would match the results that its formula can deliver, and maybe then people would be satisfied with what they can get from this product. 
					</p>
				<p>If what you are looking for is a product that can enhance your capabilities in the bedroom, then Maximum Male Pro may not be the right product. You’d be better off with products like UltraCore Power, which despite its amazing strength in increasing test, you’d also benefit from its other ingredients that are quite capable of improving your skill between the sheets. Maximum Male Pro is a capable supplement, just as long as you don’t take its claims at face value. </p>

            <section>
				<p class="p1">Fuss-free, easy solution to every man’s sexual health issues</p>
				  <img class="imgbanner1 prod1" src="images/maximum-male-pro.jpg" alt="image of maximum male pro" title="maximum male pro">
				<p class="floatext">I’m going to throw in another excellent male enhancement supplement that ought to be in consideration as part of this list – a supplement that was developed to be a no-fuss, no-frills, and easy solution for the most common sexual health problems men face on a daily basis: Max Erection Extreme. Pretty impressive. What I can tell you about Max Erection Extreme is that it was formulated to address the usual rash of sexual health issues concerning men, and it was developed such that it would be an all-purpose pill you can take whenever you feel you need a boost.</p>
					   <a href="#"> <img class="imgbutton" src="images/visit-official-website.jpg" alt="image of visite official site" title="visite official site link added"></a>
				<p>  Like Maximum Male Pro before it, Max Erection Extreme is a solid product that stands on its own merit and is likewise a great introduction to male enhancement.</p>
				<p>  Max Erection Extreme is something I can recommend to beginners as an alternative to its higher-ranked peers in this list because it addresses the great majority of sexual health problems all of us encounter as men. It’s also available at a very competitive price point, thus it is also a supplement for those working with budgetary constraints, without the fluff. Well, when a supplement works as reliably as Max Erection Extreme does, who needs the fluff? For men who feel the brunt of aging because of the sexual decline, Max Erection Extreme may be enough.</p>
				<p>  You will, however, find that there may come a time when you may need something more potent, but Max Erection Extreme works just as well as any of the top-ranked supplements on this list, only that its peers have more precise formulations each with its own proprietary technology or set of ingredients that target specific aspects of male sexual health. Max Erection Extreme will do in a pinch – and that goes for many men who seek just that extra pep in their step when they feel their libido is low. Solid, if unspectacular product that is reliable, which has more for it going than 95% of the current product out in the market today.</p>

			  <h2 class="h2faq">Chad Harris’s Ultimate FAQ on Male Enhancement</h2>
            <section>
				<p> With over 15 years in the fitness industry, I’ve gotten used to the frequent questions from friends and family about weight loss, bodybuilding, and many more. After I delved into the world of nutrition and supplements, I realized that there are many more who have questions about supplements that need to be answered. </p>
				<p> Supplements have such a huge value to your health, and not many have the privilege and access to the information to make an informed decision. That’s why I compiled the following Q&A to give you answers to questions you may possibly have. If you have any questions, you can e-mail or send them directly using the comment form below. </p>
			 <br>
			 <h3 class="faqh3">#1: Do test-boosting supplements actually work?</h3>
			 <p>YES and NO. The science supporting male enhancement supplements are quite extensive. You’d be surprised to see how many solutions were confirmed and disproved by scientific studies. So YES, male enhancement supplements work, but not all products sold as male enhancement supplements actually work. Some are basically just powdered herbs that literally produce no physiological benefits. These are products sold by fly-by-night companies that are only out to get your hard-earned money. The products you should be focused on are supplements that have an extensive history, with legitimate science, technology, and ingredients to back up their claims. </p>
				<br>
			<h3 class="faqh3">#2: How important are T-Levels in men?</h3>
			 <p>Your T-levels represent how much of the “good” androgen you have in your body. T-Levels include Free T, which represents the kind of androgen that can enhance your libido, lean muscle development, energy, and many more. As you get older, t-levels naturally decline, because the body doesn’t need it as much. However, as your t-levels decline, you also lose out some of the masculine aspects that t-levels develop, such as libido, lean muscle, and energy. Your T-levels may show up as normal, as the normal range is only relative to your health, and is only meant to spot diseases that normally decrease t-levels. But if you WANT to increase your libido and performance, your normal t-levels simply won’t cut it. You need a supplement that will help you increase your t-levels to gain the results you want.  </p>
				<br>
			<h3 class="faqh3">#3: Is there a product that gives you INSTANT results?</h3>
			 <p>Now, let me smarten you up on an industry secret: whenever a supplement claims to get you “instant” results, it may very well be an exaggeration by its manufacturers. Some supplements may be absorbed faster than others, while some are slow burners that deliver big results over a specified timeframe. Many products claim to produce instant results, but only a select handful have really shown the technology, ingredients, and formula for fast absorption into the system required to see instant results.</p>
			 <p>Worse, there are certain brands that claim instant results that may possibly be adulterated with chemicals, drugs, or components that were not approved to be included in supplements – fortunately, most of these products are banned. This is due to the unclear effects these products have on your health, which may possibly be harmful or have contraindications that require a licensed physician for you to be given a prescription.</p>
				<br>
			 <h3 class="faqh3">#4: How do I know if the product is a scam or otherwise?</h3>
			 <p>The old adage rings true for male enhancement supplements in general: if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. Examine the product. Study the literature. Study how the ingredients and how the technology behind the product works. Remember, if it is a good deal today, then it should be a good deal tomorrow. Don’t be pressured into buying a supplement without you knowing what’s actually in it – especially considering the fact that over 90% of male enhancement products out in the market today are cheap, shoddy, and possibly ineffective, or at worst, be downright harmful to your health.</p>
				<br>
			<h3 class="faqh3">#5: Why did [insert pill here] not work for me?</h3>
			 <p>See, each supplement works differently depending on every person’s situation. While some men may experience immediate results, others might see results a little later. Every male enhancement supplement usually has its own set of prescribed instructions as to how it is best used, and my personal recommendation is to follow these instructions. If you see results, great – you have yourself a supplement that works for you. For others, and this will be the majority, you may not see any results at all, which is not surprising because again, only 10% of the current male enhancement supplements on the market actually deliver the promises they make. The rest are fakes and scams by unscrupulous manufacturers to make an easy buck.</p>
				<br>
			<h3 class="faqh3">#6: Nothing works for me. Should I consider test replacement therapy?</h3>
			 <p>Let’s be straightforward here – there are some medical conditions that drastically impair your body’s ability to produce test, and if you suspect that you have such a condition, then you should seek the advice of a physician. However, these medical conditions are typically too drastic that doctors often spot these conditions on the onset of their symptoms. If you are just simply feeling sluggish or weak, it’s best to try the best test-boosting options first before going head-on with test replacement therapy. </p>
				<br>
			 <h3 class="faqh3">#7: What’s the first thing I should look for when purchasing test-boosting supplements?</h3>
			 <p>Well, the first and foremost thing you should look for when you consider buying an enhancement pill is to make sure it has a no strings attached money-back guarantee – it’s the least you could do to protect yourself and your rights as a consumer. I also recommend you to examine what’s on the label – many products out there have literature and science to back up their claims, but it all boils down to you making your research as well. Make sure that there are no chemicals, no drugs, and no harmful compounds and contraindications that may require a prescription. Last, but definitely not the least, do your research on customer feedback – you wouldn’t want to buy a product that has had horror stories attached to it.</p>
			  <p>You CAN change your life with the right male enhancement pill – all you need to do is to do your own research as I have. Or you can listen to what I have prepared on this site, so you don’t have to make the same mistakes as I did. Your choice – it’s all within your hands.</p>

			<img class="imgbanner1" src="images/scam-exposed.jpg" alt="image scam exposed" title="scam exposed">
            <section> 
				<p>  There are over 1,500 (and counting) male enhancement supplements out in the market right now. And, based on my own estimation, only 5% of them can actually deliver the results you wanted in the first place. 95% of the rest of them do not!</p>
				<p>  That’s an astronomically large chance of getting ripped off. You’re literally a sitting duck in the hands of unscrupulous manufacturers seeking a quick buck from your legitimate male sexual health concerns.</p>
				<p>  That said, how do you protect yourself against said unscrupulous manufacturers and distributors?</p>
				<p>  I’ll show you how.</p>
				<p>  I’ve had to learn these facts the hard way. Back in the day when I first started in the world of fitness, the information about supplements wasn’t as reliable and available as they are today. You either had to trust what they claim or be skeptical about it and wait for others who would hopefully vet if for you. I’ve been lured into buying supplements that I thought would work, and I lost a ton of money on these supplements. I then had the right mind to do my research, train myself on how to spot scams and look for the tell-tale signs of a good product. </p>
				<p>  See, scammers rake big bucks every day from honest men who only want to improve themselves and change their sex lives for the better, and I do genuinely feel for the great majority of men who count themselves in this category – with this quick guide, I will hope to have enlightened those of you who earnestly want to improve themselves as to how to spot these scams from the get-go, and avoid getting ripped off.</p>
				<p>  Without much further ado, let’s get to the first male enhancement supplement scam: free trials.</p><br>

			 <h3 class="scamh3" >#1: The “Free Trial” Scam</h3>
			 <p>This is undoubtedly one of the most common ways people get scammed into buying male enhancement supplements that are low-class. This is a scam wherein prospective buyers are baited (or downright deceived) into registering for a free product trial, thinking that there are no strings attached nor anything to lose as it is, after all, a free trial…only to find out that they have really been suckered into a bad deal.</p>
			 <p>Companies that offer this free trial “deal” will usually ask for your credit card details to charge you for the shipping or handling fee. See, while paying for shipping fees in what claims to be a “free trial” is a fair deal, there is a very extremely fine print that will mention a membership plan that would charge you the price of one bottle on a monthly basis. Then. While you would pay for the shipping cost of the free trial as agreed, you are actually charged for the membership plan on your credit card.</p>
			 <p>How do you avoid this scam? Remember: the large print giveth and the fine print taketh away. Read through all the literature and the fine print that is scattered all over the sites that sell these products! Make sure that the agreements you agree to are ironclad in your favor, and that nothing sketchy is hiding underneath the fine print. If you have been unwillingly charged, contact your card issuer to cancel.</p>
			    <br>
			<h3 class="scamh3" >#2: Membership Scams</h3>
			 <p>While memberships are an accepted practice for many reputable supplement companies, not all relationships are beneficial to the customer. Some companies may charge a flat fee to cover the retail cost of one bottle of their product, and as usual, the scam is written right on the fine print that many of us just disregard.</p>
			 <p>You can avoid this type of scam by first determining what you are actually paying for: are you paying for a bottle of the product, or are you paying to receive a discount? While memberships are usually beneficial to both parties because it lowers costs for both, in the end, you aren’t saving anything with it if you are being charged the retail cost of a bottle every month. More often than not, you may have not reviewed the authorization to charge your account on a monthly basis for the membership. Let me reiterate: READ THE FINE PRINT before agreeing to any sort of membership!</p>
			 <br>
			<h3 class="scamh3" >#3: Fake, Low-Quality Ingredients</h3>
			 <p>Have you ever stopped and thought for one second about what is in the supplements you are taking? Have you ever bought a male enhancement supplement that seemed rather sketchy, or worse, tampered? Then you might have been a victim of a supplement with fake or low-quality ingredients. I know this for a fact: many brands sell capsules that are bursting at the seams with sugar powder as an extender, making it look as though it was packed with beneficial ingredients – making their product literally useless. Another group of supplements uses ground herbs instead of standardized and tested extracts which would similarly produce little if any effects – cutting a product with an extender is a devious practice that has fooled many a person into buying shoddy products.</p>
			  <p>The best way to avoid such scams is to disregard the “mg per serving” content on the bottle to see how much of the real extracts you are getting – rather, make sure that the literature of the product you’re looking at is sound and makes scientific sense, because there may not be a clear distinction whether you are getting standardized extracts which are preferable, or getting ground herbs, which have little to no effect on the human body.</p>
			 <br>
			 <h3 class="scamh3" >#4: Fake Products</h3>
			 <p>Fake products are a very real threat to many unsuspecting customers. Some blatantly dishonest manufacturers or suppliers might rip off a leading brand’s intellectual property to deceive people into buying their fake product thinking they are getting the real thing. Due to the number of online marketplaces that have made it easier for all of us to access our favorite products, it has also opened the door to opportunistic scammers taking advantage of said online marketplaces to sell fake and possibly unsafe rip-offs.</p>
			 <p>While not all products on online marketplaces are counterfeits, it’s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
			 <p>Protect yourself from fakes by making sure to purchase male enhancement supplements directly from the product’s official website – if not, try to look for your desired product’s accredited partner or reseller to make sure you are buying the real thing.</p>
			 <p class="centerp">These, my friends, are the most common ways in which the average man is scammed into buying a defective or worse, unsafe male enhancement product – while there is no way to be fully 100% safe from being scammed, there are ways you can protect yourself, and they are concrete, foolproof steps: read the fine print, buy direct or from official resellers, and please, please, please – I cannot say this often enough – if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Keep well.</p>
